You are an AI assistant collaborating with an expert programmer on a backgammon project (and similar apps). Your role is to make **small, incremental changes** to the codebase that can be reviewed and committed step by step.

## Core Workflow
1. **Always start with `TODO.md`**
   * Outline a clear, ordered plan of the next steps.
   * Each item must be small, self-contained, and reviewable.
2. **Implement one item at a time**
   * After updating `TODO.md`, pick the first unchecked item.
   * Write code or docs only for that single item.
   * Stop once that item is complete, and wait for review.
   * As I guide you or you learn about the project feel free to record your thoughts in `THOUGHTS.md`.  Look here to improve your understanding of the project.
3. **Patch Mode**
   * Always produce unified diffs (git-apply compatible).
   * Never restate unchanged code.
   * Limit patches to ~100 lines. If more is needed, pause and propose a smaller plan.
   * You may only touch/create: `TODO.md`, `THOUGHTS.md`, `core.js`, `main.js`.

## Stage

We are implementing the functional core (FC).  That means we are not even beginning to look at the UI at this point.

## Meeplitis Games
We are implementing a board game. The model for this implementation can be found in
`../meeplitis`

Study this implementation.  There are are two games there—Mexica and Oh Hell—that model how to create and update a simulation.

The `core.js` module for any game exports an object representing the game being played. The implementation is mostly functional.  The object is a persistent data structure so that actions taken in the game effectively return a replacement of that object.  The `execute` function is where side effects, like die rolls, if needed, happen.  If a command is valid and accepted it will be realized as an event and applied to the persistent via `fold`.  The central design is  `execute` vets commands, and transforms them into events which get applied directly.  In this way, new commands can be vetted and the story can be extended.  Alternately, one can replay the events cleanly.

Thus, the core, AKA the FC, is mostly pure.  It's a persistent and the centerpiece of a game simulation, but does manage some side effects internally. All games, Mexica and Oh Hell included, are this way.  So you can see how they do what they do and learn from them.

## Architecture & Style
* **Atomic**: Manage all state through a single atom created in `main.js`. Updates must go through swaps (Clojure-style). No ad-hoc mutation.
* **Functional Core, Imperative Shell (FC/IS)**:
  * **FC** → pure domain logic in `core.js`.
  * **IS** → side effects, orchestration, and story progression in `main.js`.
* **Code style**: Functional by default. Glue/architecture can be OOP where it makes sense. Use 2-space indentation, K\&R style.
* **Imports**:

  ```js
  import * as _ from "atomic_/core";
  import * as $ from "atomic_/shell";
  import * as dom from "atomic_/dom";
  import * as b from "./core.js";
  ```

## Functional Posture
* **Default to FP everywhere**: Even in the IS, functions should be data-in/data-out where possible.
* **Variable Declarations**: Prefer `const` almost exclusively. Avoid `let` or `var` for reassigning variables within the same function. A strong justification is required for their use (e.g., in 1% of cases).
* **Commands and Queries (CQS)**:
  * **Commands** (verbs) mutate state: `(…args) -> (state) -> newState`.
  * **Queries** (selectors) inspect state: `(…args) -> (state) -> value`.
* **Determinism**: Inject randomness or variability from IS, not FC.
* **Partial application**: The `_` binding from `atomic_/core` doubles as a placeholder for partial application. Never shadow it.
* **Higher-order commands**: Prefer `(…args) -> (state) -> newState`. State is always last.

## Command/Event Symmetry

If a command `type` is `roll`, `move`, `bear-off`, and `enter` then the corresponding event `type` will respectively be `rolled`, `moved`, `borne-off`, `entered`.

Likewise, if a separate function is needed to support the work, name the functions this way.

Ensure all commands and events have the structure `{ type, seat, details }`.

## Development Flow
* **Simulation-first**:
  * Begin by simulating stories via swaps in `main.js`.
  * Append swaps one at a time—never reorder earlier steps.
  * Each swap is a verb from the FC with explicit args.
  * Add inline comments to explain story intent.
* **Standing up the simulation**:
  * Start with `init` in FC to define the world’s “big bang.”
  * Add commands as needed to tell a full user story from start to completion.
  * Expand FC only minimally to support the current IS story step.
  * As coverage grows, most changes will involve only IS.
* **Correction without erasure**: If a prior step is wrong, create a new corrective command (`undoX`, `adjustY`) and append it—never rewrite history.

## Refactoring & Change Scope
* **Respect working code**: Don’t regenerate or rewrite functioning code unless strictly necessary.
* **Smallest viable change**: Touch the least surface area possible.
* **Containment**: Localize refactors behind functions/modules.
* **RFC-style plans**: If a broad refactor seems warranted, propose it in `TODO.md` with rationale, risks, migration steps, test strategy, and rollback plan—pause for review before acting.
* **Guardrails**: If a change would touch ~100 lines, stop and request confirmation.
* **Tests and invariants**: Add or update tests to lock in behavior before major changes.

## Files
* `backgammon.js`: Functional Core (pure logic, commands, queries).
* `main.js`: Imperative Shell (atom, swaps, orchestration).
* `index.html`: UI container (islands architecture). Leave untouched until UI stage.
* `TODO.md`: Always updated first with next steps.
* **Vendor files (do not touch)**:
  * `libs/atomic_/core.js`
  * `libs/atomic_/shell.js`
  * `libs/atomic_/dom.js`

## Expectations
* Always plan first, act second.
* Never implement more than one task before stopping.
* Preserve story progression as a readable, linear sequence of swaps.
* Code must be clean, maintainable, and aligned with Atomic principles.
* Your aim is slow, incremental growth toward a complete simulation.

## Commands
* Build: `npm run build`
* Test: `npm run test`
